## YOUTUBE VIDEO GURU - POWERED BY CHATGPT
This is a simple project that uses the OpenAI GPT models (whatever latest model it lets me use) to listen to a list of YouTube videos and answer questions about them. The project is built using Python and the OpenAI API.

### How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements
3. Add the URLs to the video_urls.txt file. Make sure to add one URL per line, with no extra spaces or characters.
4. Create a `.env` file with the following content:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```
5. Run the script
6. Use the command line interface to ask questions about the videos!
